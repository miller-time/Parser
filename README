karmaparse.py

This is a testing environment to see how I can interact with karmabot
using PLY. It gives you an irc-like prompt where you can talk to karmabot and it
responds as expected.

To use
*******

[requires python, ply]

I recommend checking out virtualenv. By installing that, you can run the
command:

    virtualenv ENV

followed by:

    source ENV/bin/activate

and you've got your own environment you can run setup.py in. That being said,
the next step is to run:

    python setup.py develop

which should install any dependencies you need. Now you're ready!
Change to the parser directory:

    cd karmaparse

And launch the test prompt:

    python gram.py

To see available commands type this at the prompt:

    karmabot: help
